h4. This sets up a base jukeman server and configures it to be a master or a slave.

p. Here are the commands you need to run on a bare metal 64-bit Ubuntu 9.10 Server (or Desktop) install to get things rolling.

bc. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openssh-server git-core
bc. git clone git://github.com/jonmagic/jukeman_installer.git && cd jukeman_installer && sh install

*NOTE: If a base server install doesn't list a sound card (aplay -l) after installing alsa-utils, then you need to install the Desktop version of Ubuntu and then disable gdm from starting by doing the following:*

# sudo nano /etc/default/grub
# Change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash text"
# Also make sure the GRUB_TIMEOUT=3 line doesn't have quotes around the timeout number, or it will stick at the grub menu
# Save and close the grub file
# sudo update-grub
# reboot
